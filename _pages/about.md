I'm a scientist originally from Montreal, now working at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. I mostly do instrumentation design and characterization, but I've been known to fabble in simulations and data analysis. I mostly work on gamma-ray telescopes. I spend a lot of time making sure my VHDL doesn't induce race conditions.
