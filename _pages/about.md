I'm a scientist originally from Montreal, now working at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center via CRESST II and UMD. I mostly do instrumentation design and characterization, but I've been known to dabble in simulations and data analysis. I usually work on gamma-ray telescopes but I've also worked a bit on fast optical transients and radio interferometry. I spend a lot of time making sure my VHDL doesn't induce race conditions.
